# Arcade Head-to-Head

A simple Next.js application to allow users to compete head-to-head in Hack Club Arcade.

This application is meant to provide motivation for those who would like a friendly competition with their peers.

Try it out @ [https://arcade-h2h.vercel.app](https://arcade-h2h.vercel.app). All you need is both user's arcade API key, which you can obtain by running `/api` in the Slack.

Keep in mind that the Hack Hour API only allows 10 requests per minute, so if it is taking an unusually long time to display results, the site is probably under heavier load and you will have to wait and try again in a few moments.

Enjoy :)
